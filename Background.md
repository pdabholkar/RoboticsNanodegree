I had enrolled in the Robotics Nanodegree a month ago when Udacity frst announced their 30 day free offer. I had gotten 1/3 of the way throuugh and wanted to complete the course in the free month, but as with most resolutions that did not work out and after a lot of deliberation and thanks to a generous discount offered by Udacity, I continue to be enrolled in the course. The goal is to fininsh the remainder of the course in the next one month.
This website will serve as an account of my experiences.
